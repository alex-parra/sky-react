# Sky React Assessment

by Alex Parra on 2021-02-05

## Tasks
- The current grid is implemented using some CSS applied using a class on a div in the traditional way (see App.js). The task requirement is to remove the current CSS implementation and build a reusable grid component to place it in the ‘layout’ folder with the other layout components.
  `NOTE: The complexity of this component is up to you. We understand time constraints, so we will consider the requirement fulfilled even if the component is made in its simplest form.`

- The card component UI currently has an image at the top and the text is at the bottom of the card. We would like you to flip this layout, while keeping all the card elements of the same height. See attached image for visual reference.

- Add type checks on components where you feel it’s required.

### Bonus points
- Align the grid with the top navigation
- Fix the like button of the card
- Write a test for the like button

### Technical constraint
- Grid and item alignment must be achieved without using the new CSS Grid specification.
- The CSS should be handled using only styled components
- No plugin or library is allowed to fulfil the requirements. You should be able to find all you need in the current codebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
